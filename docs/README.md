# Julia for HPC Users

[Presentation Mode](https://jblaschke.github.io/HPC-Julia/presentation_index.html#)

A collection of Julia Examples for NERSC's Cori and Perlmutter systems. Code
examples [here](https://github.com/JBlaschke/HPC-Julia).

This page gives a gentle introduction to Julia from the perspective of HPC users.

The contents of this presentation is based on my 6-ish years of experience using Julia for scientific data processing (and for fun!). For deeper reading (including more HPC aspects), I recommend:
1. [carstenbauer/JuliaHLRS22](https://github.com/carstenbauer/JuliaHLRS22)
2. [ENCCS/Julia-for-HPC](https://github.com/ENCCS/Julia-for-HPC)

**Note:** this is living document -- some part of it is always under development. If you have questions, or encounter bugs, please file an issue here: https://github.com/JBlaschke/HPC-Julia/issues

## Outline

This page gives a gentle introduction to Julia ith enough hands-on experience in Julia to start applying it to their own projects, or use Julia as a teaching tool in the classroom.

1. Gentle introduction to the Julia language
2. Working wiht array-based data
3. Calling external codes (using the C-API, and `PyCall`)
4. Working in Parrallel
